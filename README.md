# Trip Duration Prediction

## Introduction
This is a project to determine the duration a taxi would take between 2 points in a city, depending on the date, time, pickup and dropoff coordinates. This is a problem which cab aggregators like Uber, Lyft, etc. try to solve for efficient pricing of the trips and determining when a cab would be available to pick up the next customer.
